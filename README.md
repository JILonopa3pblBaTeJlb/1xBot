# 1xBot
This is a simple Telegram bot that allows users to roll random sets of emojis. The bot will select emojis from two predefined sets, and there is a small chance to win by rolling three identical emojis.

Register a new bot on Telegram by talking to the BotFather. After registering the bot, you will receive a unique bot token.
Replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN in the 1xbot.py script with the unique bot token you received from BotFather.

Usage

Run the bot script using Python 3.7 or higher:

  python3 1xbot.py

After the bot starts, you can use it in Telegram by typing /roll in a chat with the bot. The bot will respond with a random set of emojis. If you roll three identical emojis, you will receive a winning message.
